RandomnessDetector
==================


##what's this?
A small library to segment a string and to see if it's generated by random.

This project rewrite Peter Norvig's [post](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) in java.
And some revision has been added such as the roughly selected frequent Chinese pinyins has been added to the word frequency file.

##Usage

use default word probability distribution provided here http://norvig.com/ngrams/
```java
		 Detector dt=new Detector();
		 dt.computeDefaultProbDist();
		 System.out.println(dt.segment("dhelloworldd"));
```

use specified word probability distribution

```java
		 Detector dt=new Detector();
		 dt.computeProbDist("/home/limeng/downloads/word_count.txt");
		 System.out.println(dt.segment("dhelloworldd"));
```
